<h1>War</strong></h1>

This is a simulation of the popular card game War.<br>
It runs the game a set number of times and produces some statistical results.<br>
The Rules of the game are thus set forth:

<h3>The Deal</h3>

The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time. 

<h3>The Play</h3>

Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles. If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places three cards face down and turns another card face up. The player with the higher card takes all cards, and so on.

If a player does not have enough cards to participate in a War, he instantly loses.
